Non-curriculum non-specific extra exercises and/or bonus practice.

1.  Extra non-graded practice
2.  Code previously written as solutions to other exercises, by me,
    but refactored in a different languages such as, Java to Javascript,
    and etc.
3.  Incomplete or not working code
4.  Code with no clear direction in mind
